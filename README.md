# Fundamental
Basic data types
Like most languages, Python has a number of basic types including integers, floats, booleans, and strings. These data types behave in ways that are familiar from other programming languages.
Numbers
Integers and floats work as you would expect from other languages. Note that unlike many languages, Python does not have unary increment (x++) or decrement (x--) operators.
Booleans
Python implements all of the usual operators for Boolean logic, but uses English words rather than symbols (&&, ||, etc.):
Strings
Python has great support for strings as well as String objects have a bunch of useful methods
You can find a list of all string methods in the documentation - (https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#string -methods)
